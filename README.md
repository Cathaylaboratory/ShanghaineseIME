# ShanghaineseIME
It is a collaborating process to finish the Shanghainese IME

* please add your codes at the end row in the taichow.kmn file below
* please simulate the sentence I have already provided for you
* the sentence and two types, the first type is
# 'romanization' + [K_TAB] > 'kanji'
only for long words without possibility of duplication

and the second type, a single pronounciation for many characters
# 'romanization' + [K_TAB] > 'A'dk(nameofromanization)
# 'A'dk(nameofromanization) + [K_TAB] > 'B'dk(nameofromanization)
# 'B'dk(nameofromanization) + [K_TAB] > 'C'dk(nameofromanization)
# 'C'dk(nameofromanization) + [K_TAB] > 'D'dk(nameofromanization)

you need to name each pronounciation inside the dk() so computer won't mix them up. I use A B C D to represent those Kanji you will put in here.

You can contribute whatever you think is correct and necessary in Wu language
